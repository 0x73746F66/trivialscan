# Errors, Exceptions, and non-validation reasons

1. If `Validator.certificate_valid`=`False` then 
2. If `Validator.certificate_chain_valid`=`False` then 
3. If `Validator.certificate_verify_messages` list is not empty, then eitehre an external OpenSSL error was captured, or the following validation check was `False` and has further information.
4. If any `Validator.validation_checks` fields are `False`, these are the meanings:

- **certificate_valid_tls_usage**; server cert only. Fails when both `serverAuth` or `digitalSignature` key usages are not provided
- **common_name_valid**; server cert only. the Common Name or `CN` in the subject was missing or malformed
- **common_name_defined**; Fails if the common name, or `CN` of the subject, is missing for any certificate
- **match_hostname**; server cert only. the Common Name or `CN` in the subject was  malformed, or did not match the host name. The same applies to `subjecctAlternativeNames` if provided
- **not_self_signed**; server cert only. Fails validation if self-signed
- **trusted_ca**; server cert only. if the issuer CA is not present in the currently trusted CA store
- **not_expired**; Fails when any certificate in the chain has expired
- **issued_past_tense**; Fails when any certificate in the chain has an issue date in the future, which indicates it will not be valid until at that date has passed
- **avoid_known_weak_signature_algorithm**; If any deprecated signature algorithm is used, the certificate is assumed to be vulnerable and considered untrustworthy
- **avoid_known_weak_keys**; If any deprecated public key algorithm is used, the certificate is assumed to be vulnerable and considered untrustworthy
- **avoid_deprecated_protocols**; If server negotiated a deprecated protocol, the certificate and entire connection is assumed to be vulnerable and considered untrustworthy
- **not_revoked**; Certificates that include any CRL or an OCSP extension has been checked and found that this certificate was revoked
- **certificate_chain_valid**; Fails if there were errors building the chain path for any reason, there are numerous chain building conditions to list them all in this format.

5. If a `ValidationError` is encountered, you have an error that prevented the assessment from completing. The following are known causes:

- VALIDATION_ERROR_TLS_FAILED
- VALIDATION_ERROR_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION

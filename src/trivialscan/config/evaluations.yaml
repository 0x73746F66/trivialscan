    issue: >
      Certificate authorities implementing CAA perform a DNS lookup for CAA resource records, and if any are found, ensure that they are listed as an authorized party before issuing a digital certificate.
      Third parties monitoring certificate authority behavior might check newly issued certificates against the domain's CAA records. RFC 8659 states; CAA records MAY be used by Certificate Evaluators as a possible indicator of a security policy violation. Such use SHOULD take into account the possibility that published CAA records changed between the time a certificate was issued and the time at which the certificate was observed by the Certificate Evaluator.
      The CAA records can help with the enforcement of your corporate policies on approved CAs. By aligning the CAA records with the list of corporate approved CAs, the risk of non-compliance to the policy is minimized.
      If CAA records exist but do not include an approved or preferred CA for a specific domain, the issuance of certificates by that CA to the domain cannot proceed until the creation of the appropriate CAA record is completed.

    issue: >
      CT brings transparency to the SSL/TLS certificate system that supports the web. SSL/TLS protocols underpin HTTPS and Web PKI. A lack of transparency weakens the reliability and effectiveness of encrypted connections, which can compromise critical TLS/SSL mechanisms. As a result, they can enable a wide range of security attacks, such as website spoofing, server impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
      Web PKI depends on CAs acting as trustworthy gatekeepers by issuing certificates only to the right parties and by avoiding giving additional permissions accidentally to those parties. An important part of how CAs meet these obligations is to design their systems so they are resilient to failure.

    label_as: Trustworthy Certificate Transparency
    issue: >
      Certificate Transparency (CT) is a mechanism which helps domain owners and industry watch dogs detect misissuance.
      Misissuance occurs when a Certificate Authority (CA) issues an SSL certificate improperly. This may mean that the CA included incorrect information in the certificate, issued the certificate to someone who did not represent the organization or domain, or was even compromised.
      Some browsers require certificates to have proof of being logged with certificate transparency, Safari requires up to 3 SCTs and Chrome requires between 3 and 5. The policies are far more complex than this so the generalised best practice is using at least 3 distinct SCTs per certificate.

    issue: The TLS Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) protects against TLS/SSL downgrade attacks. If enabled, the server makes sure that the strongest protocol that both client and server understand is used. Attackers can make a client attempt weaker TLS connections and exploit all the vulnerabilities associated with a given protocol

    issue: >
      The chain terminates with a Root CA Certificate. The Root CA Certificate is always signed by the CA itself. The signatures of all certificates in the chain must be verified up to the Root CA Certificate.
      Each certificate in the chain is checked to ensure it is not expired and the chain path is complete.
      When the root certificates are available in trust-store, this script will use its public key to verify the root certificate, once it verifies it will verify trust the intermediate certificate and eventually the server (leaf) certificate to complete the chain.
      Only one valid chain from trusted root to the leaf certificate is needed to be compatible with web browsers, however the entire certificate chain should be valid to be considered trustworthy as any compromised certificate in any chain would allow malicious attackers to sign a leaf certificate which would be considered valid in the parallel chain.

    issue: >
      Malicious certificates are most commonly signed by trusted certificate authority roots, to evade detection
      by blending in with legitimate traffic and making use of encryption to help hide their payloads.
      Both commodity and targeted attack malware make heavy use of encrypted command-and-control (C&C) that is
      indistinguishable from regular traffic, and ethical actors (with permission granted) will leverage tools
      called intrusion frameworks like; Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Core Impact that should be identified
      as though these were unauthorised because bad actors will attempt to emulate a penetration tester in
      order to take advantage of a trust relationship and infect you regardless.
      Phishing websites will use these malicious certificates that are identical to legitimate certificates which
      gives a false sense of security to victims who observe the strong encryption being used in their browser

    issue: >
      Continued use of weak keys in certificates puts your sensitive data at risk. Exhaustive key searches or brute force attacks against certificates with weak keys are dangerous to network security.
      As computational power increases, so does the need for stronger keys.
      If this is not the leaf certificate it is a root or intermediate which signs other digital certificates with its private key, if the private key is weak it may be compromised and all the rest of the issued certificates become useless.
      Diffie-Hellman key exchange depends for its security on the presumed difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.
      By design, many Diffie-Hellman implementations use the same pre-generated prime for their field, because of the reuse of primes generating precomputation for just one prime would expose millions of implementations. This vulnerability was known as early as 1992.
      Claims on the practical implications of the attack at the time were however disputed by security researchers but over the years it is expected that many primes were and still are being calculated practically making all primes of 2048 bit or less considered weak or vulnerable.

      Lower isn't vulnerable with proper padding however RSA implementations are widely flawed and did not consider this security characteristic therefore in practice any low exponent could indicate weakness known to be exploited by many heavily scrutinised researchers publications.
      Using exatly 65537 is an industry standard prescribed by certification authorities and compliance such as PCI DSS, Annex B.3 of FIP186-4, NIST Special Publication on Computer Security (SP 800-78 Rev. 1 of August 2007) does not allow public exponents e smaller than 65537.

    issue: >
      Domain Validated (DV) Certificates may be growing in popularity since the browsers ceased showing the organisation name along with a green padlock, but the visual change is not material to the security characteristic associated with Extended Validation (EV) Certificates. When the visual changes occurred the mainstream non-technical or the uneducated in cybersecurity masses all declared that EV Certificates are dead, but the reality and truth of the matter is EV Certificates have never been more important.
      Let's consider some facts:
      1. DV Certificates are extensively (almost solely) used by malicious actors of all types; targeted, watering hole, spray-and-pray, any type leverage DV Certificates because they are free, trusted, and easily to obtain anonymously
      2. A malicious EV Certificates is inherently forged for a target, displaying the forged organisation name to a layman in the browser was an attack on the user trust; Only "IF" the layman was savvy enough they might not trust the forged cert. Today we hide the forgery and as a result there is automatic blind trust and no mechanism for a layman to see the forgery and potentially avoid the threat. To be concise, we used to offer a possible chance to thwart an attacker, now we simply force trust upon users and offer them no means to easily verify anymore. So the changes to EV Certificates in practice made things worse, not better.
      3. Extended Validation certificates offer warranties up to $2M from my personal experience in Australia, When we are talking about a data breach like the one that happened to Equifax due to an expired EV Certificate, it matters.
      4. Legislative, Regulatory, International or Local Privacy Laws, Accreditation held for certain practices, Contractual Obligation (like PCI DSS) - all or any of these may obligate you to utilize at the least an EV Certificate, the DV Certificate has little (if any) security assurances.
      5. The DV Certificate Issuers generally don't offer any additional features, therefore even if you attempt to use certain features like ssl_stapling it will simply be ignored. These Issuers, (pick on Let's Encrypt for this one) simply prefer low-barrier and ease-of-use over any and all security characteristics - so if they don't care, why would you put any trust in their DV Certificates to secure your TLS connections?
      6. An EV Certificate inherently required an out-of-band validation, that is not automated like a DV Certificate. Therefore if an ATO (Account Take-over) or DNS hijacking attack were to be successful the attacker must be persistent and sometimes be physically attacking you. Which all takes significantly more time than the near-instant time it takes for the DV Certificates to be issued. When you operate public hosted (cloud) servers, they are typically ephemeral IP Addresses. The hazard with an IP Address that changes between distinct users is there is a possibility a patient malicious actor may get assigned an IP Address previously held by a valuable customer of the service provider. The way DNS works with TTL and caches means that some requests will still attempt to connect to IP Address you now have that were intended for the previous IP Address owner. If the IP Address the malicious attacker is assigned is rDNS checked and the malicious actor doesn't find anything of value, they can easily discard the IP Address and simply request a new one over and over until they get an IP that is of value to them. This is called IP Churn, and a paper describes how this technique that is an accepted "how things work" can be combined with DV Certificates that are also accepted as "how things work", combined allow for DNS hijacking. This is a proven attack, and the attack vectors with continue to work as long as service providers assign IP Addresses that are still fresh and DV certificates are automatically issued in nanoseconds.
      Put simply, DV Certificates are favoured by attackers and seeing one should make you sceptical, they're issued for ease-of-use and not for security purposes, and there is a trivial DNS take-over attack that can be used for targeted attacks when attackers are sufficiently motivated. An EV Certificate is the distinct opposite, attackers avoid using them unless they are desperate and motivated to ignore the risks to them, they are issued with security focus in spite of the time do validation which is an effective mitigation to the trivial DNS take-over attack.

    issue: >
      You can get issued a DV Certificate without actually validating the domain, Until 2018 the ACME protocol of Let's Encrypt did just this, relying on only SNI for the so-called DV Certificate issuance - not their fault, ACME was designed that way.
      June 2022 there are hundreds of ACME protocol Certificate Authorities issuing DV certificates and few would have learned from the 2018 disclosure and turned off the vulnerable design feature of SNI.
      There are a total of 10 methods of verification defined by ACME, few actually offer any security characteristics that can be said to 'Verify' Domain Ownership, in fact some are designed on purpose to offer DV certificates to customers of website hosting providors that can only modify the HTTP header responses, or less control and can only add a HTML tag! Neitehr of these are verifying control of a domain, let alone Validate domain control! What is a DV certificate if domain validation never occurred?
      Beyond validation itself; The ACME protocol DV Certificate Issuers generally don't offer any additional features, therefore even if you attempt to use certain features like ssl_stapling it will simply be ignored. These Issuers, (pick on Let's Encrypt for this one) simply prefer low-barrier and ease-of-use over any and all security characteristics - so if they don't care, why would you put any trust in their DV Certificates to secure your TLS connections?

    issue: >
      The security benefit characteristics of OCSP can only be enforced when the 'Must Staple' flag is present.
      Failing to include the must staple extension in a Domain Validated (DV) or Organisation Validated (OV) Certificate will allow most web browsers and HTTP clients to 'soft-fail' the OCSP check and continue with TLS without an OCSP assertion or knowledge of revocation status.
      In some web browsers and HTTP clients an Extended Validation (EV) certificate will hard-fail when an OCSP assertion is not obtained, but this functionality should not be relied upon as there have been many changes made by web browsers that are divergent from standards and break assumed security guarantees suddenly become a vulnerability.
      Everywhere the OCSP Must Staple Extension is accepted, it will be enforced for all certificates regardless of validation semantics.

      A client Certificate was presented and Mutual Authentication (MTLS) expected, if the presented client Certificate did not match the server sent subjects or the Certificate was not issued by a trusted Root Certificate Authority this connection attempt should not be considered secure.
      If a connection is established and the TLS server was misconfigred the TLS connection should be distrusted as it may be compromised, ineffetive at providing the intended security characteristics, or simply not meet the requirements for TLS which is designed to have a chain of trust that relies on Certificate issuers to follow the specification when issuing Certificates and also TLS servers configured per the specification.

    issue: >
      Multiple compression vulnerabilities exist across all SS/TLS versions when HTTPS transport naively utilises compression without taking proper care to mitigate all known attacks.
      Due to the nature and trivial complexity of most compression related attacks, and mitigated both known and inknown threats may be a futile effort, it is best practice to avoid compression and instead rely on minimising the data being transmitted to only what is needed.

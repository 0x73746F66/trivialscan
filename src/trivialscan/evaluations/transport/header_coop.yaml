  The server sent a response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents.
  COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers can't access your global object if they were to open it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks.

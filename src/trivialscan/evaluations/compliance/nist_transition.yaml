issue: |-
  The transition period closed at the end of 2013.
  The transitioning of cryptographic algorithms and key lengths to stronger cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms as recommended in NIST SP800-131A.
  A product or implementation does not meet the FIPS 140-2 applicability requirements by simply implementing an Approved security function and acquiring validations for each of the implemented algorithms (check references for the list)

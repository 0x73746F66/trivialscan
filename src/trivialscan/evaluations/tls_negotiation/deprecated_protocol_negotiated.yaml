issue: |-
  When information is sent between the client and the server, it must be encrypted and protected in order to prevent an attacker from being able to read or modify it
  This is most commonly done using HTTPS, which uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, a replacement for the deprecated Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol
  By default, most servers still support outdated and known vulnerable protocols, typically for backwards compatibility with equally outdated web browser software
  This is known as an insecure default and could lead to trivial attacks against default or misconfigured servers

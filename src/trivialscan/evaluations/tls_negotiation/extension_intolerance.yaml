issue: >
  Early versions of the protocol (SSL 3 and TLS 1.0) had no explicit mechanism for adding new functionality without introducing new protocol revisions. The only thing resembling forward compatibility is a provision that allows the ClientHello message to include extra data at the end.
  Implementations were instructed to ignore this extra data if they could not understand it. This vague extension mechanism was later replaced with TLS Extensions, which added a generic extension mechanism to both ClientHello and ServerHello messages.
  In TLS 1.2, extensions were merged with the main protocol specification.
  Given the vagueness of the early specifications, it's not surprising that a substantial number of SSL 3 and TLS 1.0 servers refuse handshakes with clients that specify extra data.

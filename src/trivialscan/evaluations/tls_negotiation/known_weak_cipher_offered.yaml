label_as: Known weak ciphers offered
issue: |-
  A cipher suite is a combination of authentication, encryption, and message authentication code (MAC) algorithms
  They are used during the negotiation of security settings for a TLS/SSL connection as well as for the transfer of data
  By default, most servers still support outdated and known vulnerable ciphers
  This could lead to trivial attacks against default or misconfigured servers

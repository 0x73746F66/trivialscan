label_as: Malicious Certificate
issue: |-
  Malicious certificates are most commonly signed by trusted certificate authority roots, to evade detection
  by blending in with legitimate traffic and making use of encryption to help hide their payloads.
  Both commodity and targeted attack malware make heavy use of encrypted command-and-control (C&C) that is
  indistinguishable from regular traffic, and ethical actors (with permission granted) will leverage tools
  called intrusion frameworks like; Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Core Impact that should be identified
  as though these were unauthorised because bad actors will attempt to emulate a penetration tester in
  order to take advantage of a trust relationship and infect you regardless.
  Phishing websites will use these malicious certificates that are identical to legitimate certificates which
  gives a false sense of security to victims who observe the strong encryption being used in their browser

  This is frequently a misconfiguration, i.e. the website domain name was not included in your common name by mistake.
  However it is a very uncommon issue and is most likely indication of compromise, where a malicious attacker is targeting website owners or visitors using phishing or impersonation and have made the error unintentionally or was unable to effectively impersonate the website correctly and are relying on visitors ignoring browser warnings.
